1. Clone and build edge turbo (latest release is v7.0.0-beta.4 and it's not what HEY uses)
1. Put latest turbo in `../turbo` in accordance to package.json
1. Start server with `npm run start:dev`
1. Navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

IDEAS:
* Keep enhancing this to end up with a non-functional version of HEY.
* Next step is HEY menu search functionality?
